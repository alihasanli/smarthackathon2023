                            <h4>Description of specialization</h4>
                            <p>&nbsp; One of the major branches of engineering, chemical engineering deals with the transformation of raw materials into everyday, useful products. The clothes we wear, the food we eat, and even the energy we use depend on
                                chemical engineering. The main task of a chemical engineer is to plan the stages and choose production methods so that the result is a high-quality product with the desired properties. For example, it was chemical engineers
                                who developed methods for the production of preservatives - substances that allow food to be stored longer. While chemical engineers work on the processes to make all these products, they also help manage the world's resources,
                                protect the environment, and ensure health and safety standards.
                            </p>

                            <h4>History of specialization</h4>
                            <p>In 1888, the Department of Chemical Engineering was established at the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) University, and University Professor Lewis M. Norton founded the world's first four-year chemical engineering
                                curriculum, Course X.</p>

                            <h4>What does the holder of this specialization do? (Job responsibilities)</h4>
                            <p>➝ Chemical engineers must know the basic principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics to solve problems that arise in the production and use of drugs, fuels, food, and many other products;<br> ➝ Large must be
                                able to design processes and equipment for large-scale production;<br> ➝ Plan and test production lines and by-product processing, direct plant operations;<br> ➝ A branch of engineering should be engaged in the design,
                                construction and operation of machines and equipment in which chemical reactions are carried out to solve real problems or obtain useful products;<br> ➝ Desired criteria must ensure finding the most economical and useful
                                way, taking into account the limitations given by maximizing and minimizing undesirables; must develop;<br> ➝ Must know the standardization and certification of processes, materials, products, equipment;<br> ➝ Must control
                                the quality of purchased products;<br> ➝ The most efficient in order to choose the production method, it should be involved in the calculation of the costs of purchasing raw materials, production processes and waste disposal;
                                the information obtained is used to control the equipment during the operation of the plant;
                            </p>
